<h1>The Best Movies According to Selley</h1>
<h2>My top 3  movies of all-time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Crash</h3>
<p>This has some many turns and suprises that I only knew what I had watched after the third time I seen it.</p>
<h3>Runnin Scare</h3>
<p>Awesome story telling about how life and what you're dealt can sometimes not be what you asked for or expected.<p>
<h3>Home Alone 2: Lost in New York</h3>
<p>No better movie than one that shows how family can sometimes annoy you but at the end of the day, they're the only family that you'll ever have.</p>
